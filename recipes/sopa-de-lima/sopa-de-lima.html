            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>4 green onions, chopped</li>
            <li>1 large green chile pepper, seeded and chopped</li>
            <li>2 large tomatoes, peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>6 limes, juiced</li>
            <li>½ lime</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>tortilla chips, for topping</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="subheader">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring the chicken broth, chicken breasts, red onion, garlic, oregano, salt, pepper, and thyme to a boil in a large pot; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove the cooked chicken to a cutting board and shred into bite-sized strips; return to the simmering pot.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook the green onions and green chile pepper in the hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir the tomatoes into the mixture and continue cooking until soft, about 5 minute more; pour the mixture into the pot with the chicken soup. Season with the salt; return the soup to a simmer. Add the lime juice and 1/2 a lime; cook another 10 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and remove the lime half; stir in the cilantro to serve.</li>
        </ol>
